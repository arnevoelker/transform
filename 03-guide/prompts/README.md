# How to Use the Spiral-Style Ghostwriting Prompt

## Quick Start

1. Copy the entire content of `content-transformation-prompt.md`
2. Paste it as your first message in a new Claude.ai conversation
3. Follow the assistant's prompts to provide required inputs

## What You'll Need

### Option A: Starting from Scratch
1. **Writing Examples** (3-5 samples from the target author)
2. **Your Raw Content** (ideas, bullet points, or rough draft)

### Option B: With Existing Pattern Analysis
1. **Pattern Analysis** (from previous extraction)
2. **Your Raw Content** (ideas, bullet points, or rough draft)

## Example Conversation Flow

### User's First Message:
```
[Paste the entire content-transformation-prompt.md]

I want to transform my content to match Arne Völker's LinkedIn style.
```

### Assistant's Response:
```
Hello! I'm your ghostwriting assistant. I can transform any content to match a specific writing style. What do you have for me today?

I see you want to match Arne Völker's LinkedIn style. Let me check what you've provided...

To begin, I need 3-5 examples of the writing style you want to replicate. Please provide:
- Published posts, articles, or content samples
- Preferably from the same platform/medium (e.g., all LinkedIn posts)
- Include full text, not just links if possible
```

### User Provides Examples:
```
Here are 3 LinkedIn posts from Arne:

Example 1:
[Paste full text of post 1]

Example 2:
[Paste full text of post 2]

Example 3:
[Paste full text of post 3]
```

### Assistant Analyzes and Requests Content:
```
Excellent! I've analyzed Arne's writing style across 6 dimensions:

[Shows pattern analysis]

Now I need the content you want to transform. Please provide:
- Title/Topic: Brief description (5-10 words)
- Core Message: Main point you want to make
- Context: Why this matters to your audience
- Key Points: Ideas, facts, or arguments to include
- Desired Outcome: What you want readers to do/think/feel
```

### User Provides Raw Content:
```
Title: AI Tools for Content Creation

Core Message: Most people use AI wrong - they publish first drafts instead of using it as a creative partner

Context: Content creators are struggling with AI, either rejecting it entirely or using it poorly

Key Points:
- AI should enhance, not replace human creativity
- First drafts are never good enough
- The human touch comes in curation and editing
- Examples of good vs bad AI usage

Desired Outcome: Readers should see AI as a tool that requires human oversight
```

### Assistant Delivers Transformation:
```
Here's your content transformed in Arne Völker's style:

KI-Tools für Content Creation:
Warum die meisten es falsch machen

Eine Beobachtung, die mich nachdenklich macht:

Die meisten Menschen nutzen KI völlig falsch. Sie nehmen den ersten Entwurf und veröffentlichen ihn 1:1. Dabei könnte es so viel besser sein.

Would you like me to:
1. Adjust any specific aspects?
2. Create another version with different emphasis?
3. Transform additional content?
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Examples
- Provide complete texts, not summaries
- Use examples from the same platform (all LinkedIn, all blog posts, etc.)
- Include recent examples that represent current style
- More examples (5) give better pattern extraction than fewer (3)

### Pattern Analysis
- If you have a previous analysis, provide all 6 dimensions
- Include specific examples and quotes from the analysis
- Note any platform-specific requirements

### Raw Content
- Be specific about your core message
- Include all key points you want covered
- Specify desired emotional impact
- Mention any quotes or data to include

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing
Provide multiple pieces of raw content after pattern extraction:
```
I have 3 different topics to transform:

Topic 1: [Details]
Topic 2: [Details]
Topic 3: [Details]
```

### Style Refinement
After receiving output, request adjustments:
```
Can you make this:
- More skeptical in tone
- Include more rhetorical questions
- Shorter paragraphs
```

### Platform Adaptation
Specify platform constraints:
```
This is for LinkedIn with a 3000 character limit
This is for Twitter/X threads
This is for a blog post (1500 words)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Output doesn't match style
**Solution**: Provide more examples or more detailed pattern analysis

### Issue: Content feels mechanical
**Solution**: Ask for a version that prioritizes natural flow over strict pattern matching

### Issue: Lost core message
**Solution**: Emphasize which points are most important in your raw content

### Issue: Wrong language
**Solution**: Specify target language in your initial request

## Pattern Library

Once you have a good pattern analysis, save it for reuse:
1. Copy the 6-dimension analysis
2. Save as `[Author]-patterns.md`
3. Reuse for future transformations

This eliminates the need to provide examples each time.
